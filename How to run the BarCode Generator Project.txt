How to run the BarCode Generator Project

First, download DOSBox 0.74-3 in the oficial website: https://www.dosbox.com/
Secondly, move the given file to the WORK directory.
Thirdly, type the following commands on the DOSBox Terminal:

masm <file_name.asm>
link <file_name.obj>
file_name.exe

Remember that you should have a file called "IN.TXT" inside the WORK directory with the following structure:

;example
START
123
456
STOP

Remember you can have up to 10 numbers in a line. You can also type other characters (eg. letters), and it will give you an error message in the "OUT.BAR" file.
